How to run program
================================================================================
Server:
	- There are currently four different servers that can be run.
	- All of them are located at kj_server_benchmark/server, however it will
	  shortened to "base_folder" to shorten the text.
	- Choose one of the servers out of the four that you want to test.
	
C++ Asynchronous Server:
	- *Note* This server can only be run on a linux based operating system.
	- Open the terminal and change directories to base_folder/c++
		- cd base_folder/c++
	- Compile and run the server
		- make async
	- Stop the server
		- Ctrl + C

C++ Synchronous Server:
	- Open the terminal and change directories to base_folder/c++
		- cd base_folder/c++
	- Compile and run the server
		- make sync
	- Stop the server
		- Ctrl + C

Java Servlet Server:
	- *Note* Unlike the others, this server does not have a command line.
	- Open the terminal and change directories to base_folder/javaservlet
		- cd base_folder/javaservlet
	- Compile and run the server
		- make
	- Stop the server
		- make stop

Node.js Server:
	- Open the terminal and change directories to base_folder/node.js
		- cd base_folder/node.js
	- Compile and run the server
		- make
	- Stop the server
		- Ctrl + C

Client: 
	- *Note* As of now, the client can only be run on Xcode. It means that 
	  it has to be run on MacOS.
	- Locate and open 2019_summer_project_client.xcodeproj. It should be 
	  located at kj_server_benchmark/client/client
	- At the top of main.cpp, set the static variable IP_ADDRESS to the
	  address of the server
	- Change the ports accordinigly
	- Build and run the client
