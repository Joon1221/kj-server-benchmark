Project name: kj_server_benchmark
Objectives: 
	- Create a tool to compare the performance of different servers
	- This tool will allow users to weigh the pros and cons of each server
	  archetype and make an informed decision on which one to use for
	  their program

Staff:
	- Lead Programmer : Joon Kang
	- Technical Director : Samil Chai

Goals: 
	- Test the performance between the C++ Synchronous, C++ Asynchronous,
	  JavaServlet, and Node.js servers
	- Test the performance between Oracle Database and MySQL Database
	- Create multiple tests to simulate different environment
		- For example...
		- Gaming
			- Real Time
			- Turn-based
		- Chatting
		- Downloading
		- Simple Websites
		- Video/Music Streaming
		- Transactions
	- Create visual 

Important Decisions:
	- The original plan was to test the C++ server in three different 
	  environments: Non-Binding Socket, Linux EPOLL, and Windows IOCP
		- We will not be using Windows IOCP 
	- Create two separate Ubuntu virtual machines
		- One is for the server itself and one is for the database

Current Progress:
- Establish a connection between client and server
	- Separate get and post requests (JavaServlet and Node.js)
	- Establish a secured connection between client and server
		- C++ and client use OpenSSL to encrypt and decrypt messages
		- JavaServlet and Node.js use HTTPS to encrypt and decrypt message
	- Handle multiple requests at once	
		- C++ use multiple threads
		- JavaServlet and Node.js by default are multithreaded 
	- Send message in json format
	- Implement chat server scenario in all servers
	- Implement video streaming server scenario in all servers except node.js
	- Analyze and display data on client side	
		- Total time taken
		- Bitrate
